Complete the analysis in the code block below. Write short (~1 sentence) 
answers to the following questions and include them in your Debiasing Faces 
Lab submission to complete the TODOs!

1. What, if any, trends do you observe comparing the samples with the highest 
   and lowest reconstruction loss?

   ANSWER: There are mostly white people who are looking pretty directly into
           the camera. Their faces take up most the screen and there are no
           obstructions such as glasses, or hair that covers the face.

2. Based on these observations, which features seemed harder to learn for the 
   VAE?

   ANSWER: There are a lot of faces in the high loss group who who are either
           not looking directly at the camera or have something that blocks
           part of the face such as a hat, glasses, or long hair. There are
           also more bright colors than in the other group.

3. How does reconstruction loss relate to uncertainty? Think back to our 
   lecture on Robust & Trustworthy Deep Learning! What can you say about 
   examples on which the model may be more or less uncertain?

   ANSWER: High reconstruction loss indicates that the model isn't good at
           recognizing certain features and representing them effectively in
           the latent space. This could be because those features are uncommon 
           in the training data, making the model less good at reconstructing
           or classifying those images.
