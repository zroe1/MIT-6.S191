# MIT 6.S191 (Introduction to Deep Learning)

This respository contains my lab work and my final project for the MIT Introduction to Deep Learning course (MIT 6.S191). I took this class summer 2023 to self study AI and neural networks. My labwork solutions are in the labs folder. Offical solutions can be found in the MIT repository for this class linked below. My final paper is saved as (add) and visual notes I created for this course can be found in the resources folder.

## Labs

My solutions are in the lab folder. They also include corrections to errors in the original code provided by MIT. Discriptions of the labs can be found below:

<ul>
  <li><b>Lab 1 (part 1): </b>An introduction to simple concepts in tensorflow.</li>
  <li><b>Lab 1 (part 2): </b>Music generation with a recurrent neural network. My favorite song I was able to generate with one of these models can be found in the labs folder.</li>
  <li><b>Lab 2 (part 1): </b>MNIST Digit Classification</li>
  <li><b>Lab 2 (part 2): </b>Diagnosing bias in facial detection systems</li>
  <li><b>Lab 3 (part 1): </b>An introduction capsa as a way to evaluate uncertainty and bias.</li>
  <li><b>Lab 3 (part 2): </b>This lab couldn't be completed because the dependency capsa is no longer availible to install.</li>
</ul>
